# Credit Card Checker
## Javascript Credit Card Checker

A Codecademy project.

Accepts credit card numbers for validation using the Luhn algorithm. Credit card companies generating faulty card numbers are identified and returned.

Future enhancements:
1. Make work for all types of credit cards (see generator site).
2. Accept a string and process or convert to array first.
3. Convert invalid numbers into valid numbers.
